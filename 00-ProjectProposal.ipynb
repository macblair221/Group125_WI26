    "Emotion has a significant impact on cognitive processes in humans, including attention, learning, and memory. <a name=\"cite_ref-1\"></a>[<sup>1</sup>](#cite_note-1) The amygdala is a brain structure located in the temporal lobe, and it is responsible for processing emotions, such as fear, anger, and anxiety. The hippocampal complex is also located in the temporal lobe, and it is responsible for memory encoding. \n",
    "\n",
    "A previous study has revealed how the amygdala and the hippocampal complex work together when forming emotional memories. <a name=\"cite_ref-2\"></a>[<sup>2</sup>](#cite_note-2) While the two brain structures are linked to two independent memory systems, the amygdala has shown to have influence on the encoding and storage of memories dependent on the hippocampal complex. The ability to attend to a stimulus is a primary factor in how well the stimulus is encoded. Since the amygdala responds to emotional stimuli rapidly, emotional events can receive priority when memories are encoded. Additionally, when memories are consolidated, events that elicit emotional responses are more likely to be remembered for later. \n",

    "In a study that experimented with autobiographical memories that varied in valence (positive or negative) and intensity (high or low), it was found that the emotional intensity affects the properties of autobiographical memories more than valence. <a name=\"cite_ref-3\"></a>[<sup>3</sup>](#cite_note-3) The study concluded that highly intense events tend to be remembered longer and with greater vividness. \n",
    "\n",
    "Another study has also found that a perspective change from a field (first-person) to an observer (third-person) reduces the emotional intensity of recalled events. <a name=\"cite_ref-4\"></a>[<sup>4</sup>](#cite_note-4) Given the study above, a field-to-observer perspective change is likely to reduce the vividness of a memory. Additionally, the study indicates that the autobiographical memory system has plasticity, and a perspective change alters the autobiographical records of recalled events. \n",

    " - [X] **A.1 Informed consent**: If there are human subjects, have they given informed consent, where subjects affirmatively opt-in and have a clear understanding of the data uses to which they consent?\n",
    " - [X] **A.2 Collection bias**: Have we considered sources of bias that could be introduced during data collection and survey design and taken steps to mitigate those?\n",
    " - [X] **A.3 Limit PII exposure**: Have we considered ways to minimize exposure of personally identifiable information (PII) for example through anonymization or not collecting information that isn't relevant for analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **A.4 Downstream bias mitigation**: Have we considered ways to enable testing downstream results for biased outcomes (e.g., collecting data on protected group status like race or gender)?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The dataset we are using was made using a crowdsourcing framework, which may introduce bias, such as language proficiency, cultural differences, and self-selection. These limitations are acknowledged, and predictions will be made with them in mind. This dataset does not make use of PII; it uses a de-identified dataset, no new information is added, and the variables we use are only relevant to the research question. The dataset includes demographic information, so we will be able to see if a particular group favors some outcome. These attributes are used only for bias assessment and not as prediction features.\n",
    "\n",
    "### B. Data Storage\n",
    " - [X] **B.1 Data security**: Do we have a plan to protect and secure data (e.g., encryption at rest and in transit, access controls on internal users and third parties, access logs, and up-to-date software)?\n",
    " - [X] **B.2 Right to be forgotten**: Do we have a mechanism through which an individual can request their personal information be removed?\n",
    " - [X] **B.3 Data retention plan**: Is there a schedule or plan to delete the data after it is no longer needed?\n",
    "       \n",
    "> The Hippocorpus dataset, which we will be using in our project, is publicly available and de-identified, stripped of all personally identifiable information, and does not collect new data. The dataset is publicly available through Kaggle and maintained by a third party. For this project, local copies of the data will be retained only for the duration of the assignment and will be deleted once the project is completed. The data will not be reused or stored long-term beyond the time of this course.\n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Analysis\n",
    " - [X] **C.1 Missing perspectives**: Have we sought to address blindspots in the analysis through engagement with relevant stakeholders (e.g., checking assumptions and discussing implications with affected communities and subject matter experts)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.2 Dataset bias**: Have we examined the data for possible sources of bias and taken steps to mitigate or address these biases (e.g., stereotype perpetuation, confirmation bias, imbalanced classes, or omitted confounding variables)?\n",
    " - [X] **C.3 Honest representation**: Are our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports designed to honestly represent the underlying data?\n",
    " - [X] **C.4 Privacy in analysis**: Have we ensured that data with PII are not used or displayed unless necessary for the analysis?\n",
    " - [X] **C.5 Auditability**: Is the process of generating the analysis well documented and reproducible if we discover issues in the future?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes, we will address blind spots in our analysis. We already noted that since this dataset was created using a crowdsourcing framework, it could favor a particular demographic, creating blind spots for other groups. We have acknowledged this and will move forward knowing that we may not be able to generalize our findings across all demographics. Our visualizations and summary statistics will be made with the data collection process in mind as well, only making conclusions about a certain group of people or excluding features in our predictions that may introduce bias. Yes, we have ensured the data we are using does NOT contain any PII. The data we are using is de-identified and does not collect any new patient data. The process of our analysis will follow a common data science project end-to-end pipeline, with every change recorded in a GitHub workflow, documenting our entire process so we can refer back to previous versions or test different models on our dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### D. Modeling\n",
    " - [X] **D.1 Proxy discrimination**: Have we ensured that the model does not rely on variables or proxies for variables that are unfairly discriminatory?\n",
    " - [X] **D.2 Fairness across groups**: Have we tested model results for fairness with respect to different affected groups (e.g., tested for disparate error rates)?\n",
    " - [X] **D.3 Metric selection**: Have we considered the effects of optimizing for our defined metrics and considered additional metrics?\n",
    " - [X] **D.4 Explainability**: Can we explain in understandable terms a decision the model made in cases where a justification is needed?\n",
    " - [X] **D.5 Communicate limitations**: Have we communicated the shortcomings, limitations, and biases of the model to relevant stakeholders in ways that can be generally understood?\n",
    "\n",
    "> The data does not use any proxies for its variables; the variables the dataset uses are all self-reported measurements given by the subjects. For example, time to complete the task, gender, race, and a few columns of quantitative ordinal variables representing different levels of cognitive exhaustion. We have tested the model for fairness between demographics. We found that ~73% of the people in the dataset are White, ~10% are Black, ~5% Hispanic, ~2% asian, and the remaining is split between other races such as API, Native, and Middle Eastern. We have also noted that ~60% of the dataset are people aged 25-39. Between genders, the dataset is split almost perfectly 50% man, 50% woman, but it's more like 49%-49% with a few non-binary/transgender identifying individuals.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> When optimizing for our defined metrics, we have noted that some of our features are quantitative ordinal values (1-5) describing different kinds of reported cognitive load. Dealing with these kinds of values in data analysis can be difficult, but we have noted that we can use imputation techniques for missing values and can utilize methods such as mean, median, mode, and even probabilistic imputation if needed. As noted above, we have recognized possible limitations and biases that may be present in our study within certain demographics and the overall population.\n",
    " \n",
    "### E. Deployment\n",
    " - [X] **E.1 Monitoring and evaluation**: Do we have a clear plan to monitor the model and its impacts after it is deployed (e.g., performance monitoring, regular audit of sample predictions, human review of high-stakes decisions, reviewing downstream impacts of errors or low-confidence decisions, testing for concept drift)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.2 Redress**: Have we discussed with our organization a plan for response if users are harmed by the results (e.g., how does the data science team evaluate these cases and update analysis and models to prevent future harm)?\n",
    " - [X] **E.3 Roll back**: Is there a way to turn off or roll back the model in production if necessary?\n",
    " - [X] **E.4 Unintended use**: Have we taken steps to identify and prevent unintended uses and abuse of the model and do we have a plan to monitor these once the model is deployed?\n",
    "\n",
    "> Although our model will only be created for the intended 'Hippocorpus' dataset, and is not designed to work across other datasets, we do have the ability to roll back or turn off the model if it is necessary. Since our model is designed for a dataset where no new values are added, the performance should remain constant over time, but it will be monitored if it's intended for future use.\n"
